# COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. **The College of Charleston requires that masks be worn while indoors and you must wear a mask at all times while in class.** Although vaccinations are currently not required, _I ask you to be respectful of the health and safety of others_. If you have not received the **COVID-19 vaccine, which is safe, free, and effective, please consider doing so immediately**. Information about the vaccine is available from the [SCDHEC website](https://scdhec.gov/covid19/covid-19-vaccine) and information about where and when to obtain a vaccine is also available on the SCDHEC website [vaccine locator page](https://vaxlocator.dhec.sc.gov/).    


# Course Description

> _Our responsibility is one of decision---for to govern is to choose_ 
> - John F. Kennedy

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent The above quote from President Kennedy came from a speech at Liberty Hall in Philadelphia on July 4th, 1962. In the audience were members of the 54th National Governors' Conference. Speaking to elected officials that were charged with making often difficult decisions, Kennedy was reminding them that making choices is at the heart of governing. How do policymakers make choices regarding public policy? This course will address this question by examining the policymaking process in the United States. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent Public policy is an on-going process of actions (or inactions) and decisions (or non-decisions) by government at all levels. The policymaking process considers the interactions of decision-makers, those trying to influence decision-makers, and the venues where decisions are made. As likely future actors in the complex process of making public policy, you will likely be involved in considering, informing, and perhaps making consequential policy decisions. The aim of this course is for students in the MES, MPA, and concurrent MES/MPA programs to develop an understanding of the ways in which policy choices are developed, considered, and made in a democratic system. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent The tools and frameworks discussed in the course will help you to be able to identify the major components and important facets of the policymaking process as well as enhance your capacity to critically analyze important policy issues. 

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent The course is divided into three sections, 1) **Foundations**: includes some of the foundational aspects of policymaking in the US such as democracy, equality, institutions, and actors; 2) **Theories of the Policy Process**: covers the major policy process theories that scholars have developed; and 3) **Applied Policy Research**: discusses how knowledge is applied to address pressing societal problems and includes policy design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation.    

\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent Laptops are allowed, but should only be used to access the readings. Phones should be put away during class.  _I encourage you to take notes by hand, with pen and paper_. [You learn better that way](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/learning/should-teachers-and-professors-ban-student-use-of-laptops-in-class.html). I recommend taking notes using the [Cornell Method](http://www.usu.edu/arc/idea_sheets/pdf/note_taking_cornell.pdf).  

## NASPAA Competencies and Course Learning Objectives 

Students who graduate from NASPAA accredited MPA programs should develop the ability to: lead and manage in public governance, participate in and contribute to the policy process, apply skills in analysis and critical thinking to solve problems and make decisions, articulate and apply a public service perspective, and communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing workforce and citizenry. **This course is designed with a special emphasis on providing students with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to participate in and contribute to the policy process**. To that end, learning objectives include:

-  Explain the various policy process theories and frameworks

-  Apply one or more of the policy process theories to a policy problem

-  Analyze policy problems and their potential solutions 

-  Develop a detailed understanding of a policy problem or issue

-  Display oral, written, and group communication skills


\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent These objectives will be achieved through critically reading the course readings; by writing several short papers; and by completing a policy report about a particular policy issue.

Decision Memo & 75 points \\
Course Reflection Essay & 25 points \\
Engagement & 100 points \\ 
\hline
Total & 700 points \\
\hline
\end{tabular}


\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent _There are 700 possible points for this course. Grades will be allocated based on your earned points and calculated as a percentage of 700_: A = 90 to 100\%; B+ = 87 to 89\%; B  = 80 to 86\%; C+ = 77 to 79\%; C  = 70 to 76\%; F = 69% and below

## Assignments 

**Specific instructions for the following assignments are posted on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/d2l/home). All work must be turned in through the Assignment folder on OAKS, and is due at class time: Monday, 5:30 PM Eastern**.

* _Reflection Papers_: You will write 10 short, about 2 pages, reflection papers that summarize and integrate the readings. Prompts will be given for each paper in [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). Note that 12 are assigned, but only 10 will be graded. **When assigned, reflection papers are due at class time.** 

	\vspace{0.10in}
	\noindent We will learn about several of the leading theories of the policy process. To help facilitate learning, the reflection papers for the policy process theories will include briefly explaining some of the major components of each of the theories and discussing what you learned about the policy process from learning about the theory. You will also need to find a find a peer-reviewed journal article that applies the theory and post a brief (about a paragraph) summary of the article as well as a pdf of the article on the [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu) discussion board. 


<!-- * _Issue papers_: You will pick a public policy issue or problem of interest to you and write a series of five short, 2 to 3 page, papers about different aspects of the issue. -->

<!-- * _Policy process papers_: -->
<!-- * _Agency paper_: You will write a short, 3 to 4 page, agency paper that discusses a government (federal, state, or local) or non-profit agency involved in implementing some policy or policies related to your issue. -->

<!-- * _Presentation_: You will give a short, five-minute maximum, presentation on the policy issue you have been researching all semester. The presentations will be given on **Dec 2 and during the final exam time on Dec 9**, and you will be randomly assigned to one of those dates.  --> 

* _Policy Report_: You will write a 10-12 page policy report. For the policy report you will define a problem; explore the policy history and policy mapping of the problem; consider three alternatives to address the problem; evaluate those alternatives; and make a recommendation.

	\vspace{0.10in}
	\noindent You will turn in drafts of parts of the policy report throughout the semester. Instructions for the report and each part of the report is on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu).

	* **Part 2 draft DUE: Sept 27**
	* **Part 3 draft DUE: Nov 22**
	* **Part 4 draft DUE: Nov 29**
	* **Final policy report DUE: Dec 10**

* _Decision Memo_: The decision memo is based on your policy report, and will be a two-page memo where you clearly distill for a decision-maker what you have learned and would recommend regarding your policy issue. **The decision memo is due December 10.**

* *Course Reflection Paper*: The course reflection paper will be a 1 to 2 page paper that will ask you guided questions so you can reflect on how well we met the course objectives. **The course reflection paper is due December 6.**  

* _Course Engagement_: Students are expected to participate in the course by asking questions, providing thoughtful comments, and through making contributions to the group discussion portion of class. **Class discussion should be better than it would have been had you not attended.** Note that the professor has final say over what does or does not count as adequate participation.

### A Note on Feedback 

Each of your reflection papers will be graded in a holistic fashion. I will examine and grade the document as whole, I am therefore not likely to make specific comments on multiple aspects of each of your papers. Any feedback will be provided on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). For the reflection papers that discuss the theories of the policy process, I will be looking to see that you adequately address each of the questions, and if you do you will likely get all or most of the points. For the rough drafts of sections of the policy report, I will provide feedback on how to improve the draft for the final report. If you adequately address what is asked for each of the papers, you will likely get all of most of the points. Any major issues with the assignments or your writing in general (such as grammar) that results in a significant loss of points (below 90%) will be addressed with feedback. Finally, I am happy to meet you with to discuss any individual paper or your writing as a whole.         

## Late Work Policy 

Late work is subject to a 48-hour grace period, and after that will be penalized 10% each day (24 hr period) it is late, up to 3 days. After 3 days the assignment will not be accepted. For example, if an assignment is due Monday at 5:30 PM, the grace period ends on Wednesday at 5:30 PM and it is late as of 5:31 PM and you lose 10%. After Thursday at 5:31 PM you lose another 10%, after Friday at 5:31 PM another 10%, and no work will be accepted after Saturday  at 5:30 PM. _No late work will accepted 72 hrs after the assignment due date and time_.

<!-- Attendance is expected and mandatory for this course. Attendance will be taken at each session through a short writing exercise at the end of each course. You are allowed to miss one class without penalty. You will lose 20 points for each absences after the first. **Attendance will be taken through short one-paragraph reflections on what you learned during that class period. You will turn in your reflection at the end of class in OAKS**.  -->
