# Theoretical Antecedents

 __Incrementalism__ (Lindblom)

* Time constraints and/or political limitations prevent full (rational) consideration of policy issues 

* Policymakers rely on past decisions resulting in a policy process of small adjustments 

* Policymakers start from existing baseline and make adjustments based on pressures from the current environment

--

**Does not allow for rapid or large policy change, which often occurs**

class: title title-1

# Theoretical Antecedents

**Mobilization and expansion of conflict** (Schattschneider) 

* _Loser appeal_: "losers" in policy conflicts attempt to expand conflict 

* Concerned outsiders

* Jurisdictional expansion 

---

class: title title-1

# Theoretical Antecedents

__Policy subsystems__

* _Substantive issue alliances that cross institutional boundaries and include both governmental (official) and nongovernmental (unofficial) actors_ (McCool 1998)

* Allow for the _parallel processing_ of issues

# Punctuated Equilibrium Theory 

__Punctuated Equilibrium Theory proposes a single process that explains both stability and bursts of rapid change__

--

* _The interaction of a changing policy image with political institutions (i.e., policy venues)_

* _Feedback dynamics_ 

* _Attention to new issues or new aspects of issues_

# Punctuated Equilibrium Theory 

* _The interaction of a changing policy image with political institutions (i.e., policy venues)_

* _Feedback dynamics_ 

* _Attention to new issues or new aspects of issues_ 

**These processes push issues from subsystems to the macro-institutions, making policy change more likely and altering existing policy subsystems**

# Group Exercise 

* Get in groups of _no more than four_ (practice social distancing) 

* Go to the _Comparative Agendas Project_ webpage: https://www.comparativeagendas.net 

* Go to the __Explore Trends Tool__ 

* Pick a policy _sub-topic_ in the US  

* Explain the dynamics of that sub-topic 
    * When did a punctuation occur? 
    * Any guesses as to why that punctuation happened?
