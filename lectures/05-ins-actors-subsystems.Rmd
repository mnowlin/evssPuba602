# Institutions and Democracy 

<br>

> If a _country_ is to be governed democratically, what would be required? At a minimum, it would need to possess certain political arrangements, practices, or institutions that would go a long way, even if not all the way, toward meeting ideal democratic criteria. 

> — Dahl, pg 83
