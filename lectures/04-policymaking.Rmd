**What is the scientific method?**

--

> _A method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement, and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses._

# Criteria of a Scientific Theory

**Paul Sabatier** 

--

-  Data acquisition and analysis methods are public and can be replicated 

--

-  Concepts and propositions should be clearly defined, logically consistent, and lead to empirically falsifiable hypotheses


--

-  Propositions should be general
    -  _Proposition_: (i.e., logic statement) declarative statement that is either true or false 

---

class: title title-1

# Criteria of a Scientific Theory

**Paul Sabatier** 


-  Methods and concepts subjected to criticism and evaluation

--

* Applies to both _quantitative_ and _qualitative_ data 

---

class: title title-1

# Criteria of a Scientific Theory

**Iron law of explanation** 

> The rule is simple: it tells scientists that, “if they are to participate in the scientific enterprise, they must uncover or generate new evidence to argue with”; from there, they must “conduct all disputes with reference to empirical evidence alone.”

**Institutionalism**: _Public policy is authoritatively determined, implemented, and enforced by government institutions_

* Congress, the presidency, courts, bureaucracies

Government institutions give public policy three distinctive characteristics:
  * Legitimacy: legal obligations; democratic; the Constitution
  * Universality: extends to all citizens 
  * Coercion: imprison violators
