--

**Conditions**: nothing can be done to address it; _it's just the way it is_

* Does it include the effects of a decision as well as the decision itself? 

--

* What is ‘the government’ and does it include elected and unelected policymakers?

--

* Does public policy include what policymakers do _not_ do?  

---

class: title title-1

--

* Policy can be action or _inaction_
