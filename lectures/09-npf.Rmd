# Epistemology 

--

**Post-Positivist** 

--

**Can we separate _facts_ from _values_?** 

--

**Knowledge _about the social world_ is dependent on social context** 
* Analyze _discourse_ and _narratives_ 
* Not _generalizable_ 

--

**Science produces knowledge according to rules, but does it uncover _truths_ about the world or a way to _interpret_ the world?**

# Epistemology 

**What does the Narrative Policy Framework assert**?

--

</br>

_They argue that, although the study of policy ‘narratives’ (often using discourse analysis) is associated strongly with post-positivist scholarship, they can be examined in a ‘systematic empirical manner’ – and that the study of narratives can be an important way to help reconcile (to some extent) positivist/post-positivist studies_.

# NPF Assumptions

--

* **Social construction**: _meaning_ 

--

* **Bounded relativity**: what matters in policy debates is bounded

--

* **Generalizable structural elements**: the _form_ of policy narratives can be applied in different contexts

--

* **Three levels**: macro, meso, and **micro**

# Micro Level: _Homo Narrans_

* **Two kinds of cognition**
  * **System 1**: _automatic thought process_ 
  * **System 2**: _focused attention_
