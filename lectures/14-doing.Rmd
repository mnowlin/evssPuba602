# A Quick Note on Citations and Sources 

**In-text, parenthetical citations are for paraphrasing** 

**If you use the same words as the source put in quotes with a page number** 

.pull-left[
* "It is important to cite your sources properly" (Nowlin 2021, 1)
    * Beyond four lines indent a paragraph

.pull-right[

# A Quick Note on Citations and Sources 

**Include a bibliography or work cited page with 10 sources beyond course readings**

**Use multiple sources** 
* What are some of the things that your source cites? Who has cited your source? 

**Feel free to use any citation style you prefer (APA, MPA), but be consistent**

# Steps in Policy Research 

**Step 1: Define the problem: _Introduction and Problem Definition_** 

_What private troubles warrant definition as public problems_? 

* Think in terms of a _market failure_ 
* Try and quantify (deficit and excess; e.g., number of homeless families)

**DO NOT: _Define the solution in the problem_** 
.small[
* e.g., the fact that marijuana is illegal
* e.g., _from the book_: there is not enough shelter for homeless families

# Steps in Policy Research 

**Step 2: Assemble some evidence: _All parts of the report_** 

* **Data**: facts about the world 

* **Information**: data that have _meaning_ 

* **Evidence**: information that affects existing beliefs 

**Review the available literature** 

**Survey "best practices"** 

* What are other counties, states, countries doing?

# Steps in Policy Research 

**Step 3: Construct the alternatives: _Policy Alternatives_** 

* "Policy options", "alternative courses of action" 
* Look to "best practices" 
* Look to BP: _Appendix A: Things Governments Do_ 
* **Describe the _causal model_** 
* Describe some pro and cons of each alternative 

**Create a sub-section title for each alternative** 
* **Alternative 1: Rent control** 

???
what is a causal model? from Birkland and policy design - what is it about policy X that would _cause_ outcome Y?

# Steps in Policy Research 

**Step 4: Select the criteria: _Policy Alternatives_** 

**This has been done for you**

* **Efficiency**: maximize social welfare. Best use of public funds

* **Political feasibility**: how politically acceptable is the alternative? How much support? How much opposition? 

* **Administrative capacity to implement (administrative robustness and improvability)**: how capable are current administrative and bureaucratic systems to successfully implement each alternative? 

---

class: title title-1

# Steps in Policy Research 

**Step 5: Project the outcomes: _Policy Alternatives_**

* Create your best guess, most realistic expectations about how each alternative will impact the problem

  * _Include this in your description of the policy alternative_ 

---

class: title title-1

# Steps in Policy Research 

**Step 6: Confront the Trade-offs: _Policy Alternatives_**

* Discuss the trade-offs associated with the expected outcome for each alternative 

**Criteria Analysis from the Radin reading** 

* Create a table with the policy alternatives as the columns, the criteria (efficiency, political feasibility, and administrative capacity) as the rows, and put high, medium, or low in the cells. 

* Briefly explain your reasoning in the the text

class: title title-1

# Steps in Policy Research 

**Step 7: Decide: _Recommendation_** 

* Which alternative is "best" based on the criteria and expected outcomes? 

**Step 8: Tell your story: all parts of the report** 

* Know your audience 
* The Grandma Bessie Test  
* Create a logical narrative flow
