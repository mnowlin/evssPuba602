# Tragedy of the Commons 

**Approach 1: Markets** 

* Establish _property-rights_ 

* **Property-rights**: The rights to own or control property and includes the right to use, to transfer ownership, and exclude from others

**Approach 2: Governments** 

* Establish government regulation

## What aspect(s) of the policy process is the _Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework_ explaining? What concept(s) does it use?

---

class: title title-1

# The IAD

**Institutions**: are human-constructed constraints or opportunities within which individual choices take place and which shape the consequences of their choices

* The **rules**, **norms**, and **shared strategies** that structure social interactions

--

.SMALL[**_Given that there is such a large variety of regularized social interactions in markets, hierarchies, families, legislatures, elections, and other situations, is it even possible to find a common terminology to study them? What are the building blocks of institutions?_**]

**Action arena**: occurs whenever individuals interact, exchange goods, or solve problems; **participants**, _rules and norms, and attributes of the physical world_ come together. 

--

**Action situation**: the rules and norms and the attributes of the physical world

--

**Interactions**

# Action Situations and Action Arenas

**Action situation**:  two or more individuals faced with a set of potential actions that jointly produce outcomes

* Participants that occupy a certain position 

--

**Action arena**: combines the action situation, which focuses on the rules and norms, with the participants who bring with them their individual preferences, skills, and mental models
