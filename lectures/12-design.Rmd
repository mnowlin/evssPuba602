# What do we mean by policy design?

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Design

**The process by which policies are designed, both through technical analysis and the political process, to achieve a particular goal**  

--

* Broadly speaking, the _content_ of public policy

--

* Enacted using _policy tools_

--

* Implemented: put into action 

---

class: title title-1

# Policy Problems

**Problems vs. conditions**

--

**How do we learn about conditions or problems**? 

* Changes in indicators
* Focusing events
* _Social constructions_ 

--

**Problem definitions $\rightarrow$ policy design**

# Causal Model 

> **A theory about what causes problem and how particular responses would alleviate the problem** 

-_Birkland_ pg 315

--
* What _causes_ outcome _Y_?   

--
* How does policy _X_ impact outcome _Y_?

--
* Causal model shapes policy tools

--
* Poor causal model can yield policy "failure"

# Policy Tools

**A method through which government seeks an objective**

-*Lester and Salamon*

--

**Elements in policy design that cause agents or targets to do something they would not do otherwise or with the intention of modifying behavior to solve public problems or attain policy goals** 

-*Schneider and Ingram*

# Policy Tools 

**Factors in tool selection:**

--

* Technically sound design does not trump politics

--

* Tool choices are constrained by resources 

--

* Tools are based on behavioral assumptions about policy targets
  * **Targets**: entities whose behavior policy will alter
  * _Social construction of target populations_ 

---

class: title title-1

# Social Construction

**Policymakers construct _target populations_ in positive or negative terms and these terms are reflected in the distribution of benefits and burdens within the policy design** 

--

* Policymakers respond to and create social constructions

--

* Social constructions are related to _power_ and _deservingness_

# Administrative Burden 

**Burdens are distributive** 

--

**Resources matter in overcoming burdens** 

--

* College applications
  * Providing information and waiving application fees made low-income students 46 percent more likely to apply to college 
  * Providing assistance in completing the FASFA led to a 26 percent increase

# Administrative Burden 

**Burdens are constructed** 

--

* Administrative burdens are the product of administrative and political choices

--

* Political actors often see burdens as a policy tool to achieve an ideological goal


---

class: title title-1

# Administrative Burden 

**Some degree of burden is necessary to prevent fraud** 

--

**Guidelines** 

* Citizens are better off when public programs are designed to be simple, accessible, and respectful of the citizens they encounter

--

* Burdens should be minimized to the greatest extent consistent with protecting important public values, such as cost and program integrity 

---

class: title title-1

# Administrative Burden 

**Some degree of burden is necessary to prevent fraud** 

**Guidelines** 

* Considerations of burden should be evidence based, identifying the multiple values involved and the likely effects of burdens on those values, and informed by logic and empirical evidence rather than by political rhetoric **or lies** 

---

class: title title-1

# Administrative Burden 

**Some degree of burden is necessary to prevent fraud** 

**Guidelines** 

* Because burdens can affect some groups more than others, we should be especially attentive to costs on those with limited resources or in programs that are specifically to help those with limited means
