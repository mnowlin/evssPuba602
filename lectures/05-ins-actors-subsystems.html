# Institutions and Democracy 

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; If a _country_ is to be governed democratically, what would be required? At a minimum, it would need to possess certain political arrangements, practices, or institutions that would go a long way, even if not all the way, toward meeting ideal democratic criteria. 

&gt; — Dahl, pg 83
