> _Along with scholars, audiences for this paper may also include people actively engaged in politics involving public policy issues or undergraduate or graduate students, who through their courses and readings are learning about various theories of public policy and politics and wondering how – if at all – these theories might matter in a career outside the craft and science of academic theoreticians_

# Influencing the Policy Process

--

* The _policy process_ is the study of change and development of policy and the related actors, events, and contexts
    * Multiple frameworks, theories, and models

--

* Learn how to draw lessons from each of these _approaches_ at the appropriate point in time and in the appropriate context. Don't focus on a single approach

# Influencing the Policy Process

**Policy participants are**:

--
* Goal oriented with goals derived from a variety of sources including interests, beliefs and values, or collective affiliations; 

--
* Limited in their cognitive capacity to process the multitude of stimuli supplied from the environment; 

--
* Reliant upon heuristics to simplify, understand, interpret, and respond to incoming stimuli; 

--
* Affected by their emotions, such as fear and trust, in reasoning, allocating attention, and making behavioral decisions.

* Belief system awareness 
* Analytic knowledge 
* Local space and time knowledge
* Conditions from other subsystems 

--

**Invest in networks**

--

**Participate for extended periods of time**

# Policy Report Part 3 

**Policy alternatives**: _About 3 to 4 pages_ 

* Come up with **three policy alternatives** to address your problem or issue 
* Draw from other countries, states, cities, interest groups, think tanks, among others 
* Include a brief discussion of the **causal model** of each alternative 
* Include a couple of pros and cons for each alternative 
* Use the Bardach and Patashnik book, pgs 21-31 (Step Three: Construct the Alternatives) as guidance
