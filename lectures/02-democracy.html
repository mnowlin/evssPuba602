# Public Policy

&lt;/br&gt; 

## A statement by government of what it intends to do, such as a law, regulation, ruling, decision, order; or a combination of these. The lack of such statements may also be an implicit statement of a policy not to do something 

-*Birkland*, pg 6

???
* Policy responds to a _problem_ 
* The policy is made on the "publicâ€™s" behalf
* Policies have goals 
* Policies are made by governments
* Policies are implemented by public and private actors
* Policy can be action or _inaction_ 
* Policy allocates values

note that this info comes from Hans Noel lecture 

claiming that the US is a republic is often used as a way to discourage reforms to make the system more democratic

# Democracy

**Is the US a Republic or a Democracy?** 

**Republic**: Latin - _res_ (entity, concern) + _publicus_ ('of the people', public )
* No monarch; Authority from the people

**Democracy**: Greek - _demos_ ('the people') + _kratia_ (power, rule)
* The people rule

# What is Democracy? 

_A system of government with regular, free and fair elections, in which all adult citizens have the right to vote and possess basic civil liberties such as freedom of speech and association_

class: title title-1

# What is Democracy? 


**One _elementary principle_ of democracy** 

_That all members [of a polity] are to be treated (under the constitution) as if they were equally qualified to participate in the process of making decisions about the policies [the polity] will pursue_


.footnote[-_Dahl_, pg. 37]

# What is Democracy? 

**Criteria for a democratic process** 

--

* Effective participation 

* Equality in voting 

* Gaining enlightened understanding 

* Exercising final control over the agenda 

* Inclusion of adults 

???

Effective participation: all members must have _equal and effective opportunities_  to make their views known 

Equality in voting: all members must have an _equal and effective opportunity_ to vote and all votes must be counted as equal 

Gaining enlightened understanding: _equal and effective opportunities_  for learning about relevant alternative policies and their likely consequences 

Exercising final control over the agenda: members must have the exclusive opportunity to decide how and, if they choose, what matter will be placed on the agenda 

Inclusion of adults: all (or at least most) adult permanent residents should have the full rights of citizens that are implied by the first four criteria

# Why Democracy? 

**Democracy produces desirable consequences**

* Moral autonomy

* Human development

The issue is whether in the long run a democratic process is likely to do less harm to the fundamental rights and interests of its citizens than any nondemocratic alternative. (Dahl, pg 48)

# Other Forms of Government 

**Socialism**: the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole
* **Communism**: control by one central government 

--

**Fascism**: led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism
* **Autocratic**: a person has rules with unlimited authority 

---

class: title title-1

# Other Forms of Government 

**Authoritarian**: central government that maintains power through repression and exclusion of challengers
* _Authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear, and economic prosperity_ 

--

**Competitive Authoritarianism**: hold elections but ensure that they are fundamentally unfair

# Democratic Backsliding 

.pull-left[
**Weakening of norms** 

**Mutual toleration**: competing parties accept one another as legitimate rivals

**Forbearance**: exercise restraint in deploying their institutional prerogatives
