> _Along with scholars, audiences for this paper may also include people actively engaged in politics involving public policy issues or undergraduate or graduate students, who through their courses and readings are learning about various theories of public policy and politics and wondering how – if at all – these theories might matter in a career outside the craft and science of academic theoreticians_

# ACF Assumptions 

--

* The policy subsystem is the main unit of analysis 

--

* Relevant subsystem actors include any person trying to influence policy

--

* Individuals are boundedly rational, motivated by beliefs, prone to the "devil shift"

--

* Subsystems are simplified by aggregating actors into one of more coalitions 

---

class: title title-1

# ACF Assumptions 


* Policies incorporate implicit theories based on the beliefs of one or more coalitions

--

* Scientific and technical information is important

--

* Researchers should adopt a long-term perspective, a decade or more, to understand policy process and change 

---

class: title title-1

# ACF's Key Terms

--

**Beliefs and Belief systems**  

* Beliefs and belief-systems are hierarchically organized

--

* Core Beliefs $\rightarrow$ Policy Core Beliefs $\rightarrow$ Secondary Aspects 

--

**Advocacy Coalitions** 

* Actors that share _policy core beliefs_ and coordinate their actions in a non-trivial manner to influence a policy subsystem

# Advocacy Coalitions 

.pull-left[
* Dominant and minority coalitions
* Collective action (free-riding)
* Principal and auxiliary coalition actors 
* Resources, strategies, and activities

# Group Exercise 

* Get in your groups. I will count you off 

* Pick a policy issue, _that isn't climate change_  

* Find one or two _newspaper_ articles about your issue

* Use the articles to identify coalition members and their beliefs 

* Report out to the class
